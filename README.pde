Brief description of the animation achieved: 
Snowmen in a wintery scene
Press the left mouse button to change the weather to summery.Stoping rain and removing snowmen. Also drawing a small flower
Press right for an Autumn effect. Here we make it sleet instead of snow.
Press center for Spring. Here we see the last snowman of the winter out in the rain.
Press any key for a chess board background

Known bugs/problems: I should have somehow made each season some form of class of its own to fully contol the screen.

Any sources referred to during the development of the assignment (no need to reference lecture/lab materials): used an example for drops from a website given on the moodle notes. Also used code I found to draw the flower.
